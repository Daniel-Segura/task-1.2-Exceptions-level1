# Task 1.2 Exceptions Level 1

### Description - Statement of the exercise üìÑ

App developed in Java using an ArrayList, custom methods, and exceptions (including custom ones) to manage data and handle errors. Inheritance concepts and error handling with throws (basic) are also applied.
#### Exercise 1
Create a class called "Product" with the attributes name and price, and another class called "Sale." This class has a collection of products and the total sale price as attributes.

The "Sale" class has a method called calculateTotal() that throws the custom exception "SaleBuidaException" and displays "To make a sale, you must first add products" if the product collection is empty. If the collection contains products, it must iterate over it and save the sum of all product prices in the total sale price attribute.

The custom exception "SaleEmptyException" must be a child class of the Exception class. We must pass the message "To make a sale, you must first add products" to its constructor and, when catching the exception, display it using the exception's getMessage() method.

Write the code needed to throw and catch an "IndexOutOfBoundsException."
